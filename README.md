# Alien-Attack-Sense.Hat-Python
Simple game that involves aliens! A random number from 1 to 100 is generated, and depending on the number, is how close the aliens are to killing you! Play on trinket.io/sense-hat.

Just copy the code into the website linked above, press "Run" and the game will start.

Firstly, a random number from 1 to 100 will be generated. This will determine if the alien is close or far away from you. A number between 76-100, means that the alien is far away (Alien spotted)(green). A number between 51-75 means that it is a bit closer (Getting closer)(yellow). A number between 26-50 means that it is almost about to kill you (Really close!)(orange). A number between 1-25 means that it killed you (You are dead!)(red).

This game is involves random generated numbers, custom set-up colors, and the Python programming language.
